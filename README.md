Goal

This study is designed to determine how much heating oil need to keep in stock to meet the new customer'sdemand based on existing customer behavior.

Data used to predict furure consumption of heating oil

Insulation: the thickness of each home’s insulation, ranging from one to ten. A higher the number has excellently insulated, lower the number has poorly insulated.  
Temperature: most recent year outdoor temperature of each customer’s home.
Heating_Oil: most recent year heating oil purchased by each customer. 
Num_Occupants:  total number of people living in the home.  
Home_Size: the home’s overall size, on a scale from one to eight. The higher the number, the larger the size.
